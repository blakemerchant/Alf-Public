# Craft Base Site

## Local setup

- Clone this repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pango-studio/craft-boilerplate.git desired-dir-name
```

- Move into the newly created project folder

```bash
cd desired-dir-name
```

>ðŸ‘€ Important! This is the base repo that shouldn't be used as your new project so next do the following:

- Create a new repository for your project

- Change the remote URL to that of your new project

```bash
git remote set-url origin new.git.url/here
```

- Create the valet link (optional)

```bash
valet link
```

- Create your `.env` from the `.env.example`

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

- Install the composer dependencies
```bash
composer install
```

>ðŸ‘€ You might see some error output about cache clearing. Not to worry! Craft isnâ€™t installed yet, so thatâ€™s perfectly fine.

- Create a new MySQL database in Tableplus

- Run the Craft Setup to update the `.env` with a generated security key and database credentials, and test the connection.

```bash
php craft setup
```

- Install Craft

```bash
php craft install
```

>Youâ€™ll be asked for things like a username, email, password, and more. These values will be written to the `.env` file and the installer will run.
>
>Be sure to enter the site URL as set up with your local server. If you miss it, you can edit it later by hand in the `.env` file which should have a variable named `DEFAULT_SITE_URL`. This is important because the AssetRev plugin configuration relies on it.
>
>After the installer runs you should be able to log into the Control Panel at `http://local-site-name.test/admin`.

- Install NPM dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Tailwind Development Flow

The original CSS and JavaScript files are in the `./src` folder.

There are two npm scripts you can run for now:

#### Development Build

```bash
npm run dev
```

This builds the largest possible CSS file with all of Tailwindâ€™s classes available to you. The resulting `./public/styles.css` is too large for production (+/- 4MB), but it allows you to explore all of the possibilities while developing.

#### Production Build

```bash
npm run prod
```

This will purge any Tailwind classes that arenâ€™t used by files in `./templates/` (and sub-directories) resulting in a very small `./public/styles.css`.
